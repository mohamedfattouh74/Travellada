I am married to Kiriaki and we have 2 sons. I own and manage many apartments in the very inner center circle of Athens (some of them beside the Metro, in 30-50m) and a few others in the larger Athens. All of them are either brand new or recently fully renovated. Depending on the apartment, they dispose free private Parking, extraordinary views of the city, Smart TVs, Satellite TV connection (1200 free channels), etc. They all beautifully decorated and dispose fully equipped (for long stays) kitchens, 42-50' LED TVs, Home Cinema, DVD collection, WiFi internet, A/C in all rooms, outdoor space (terrace, balcony, patio). What I love mostly in my work is to meet different people & cultures from all over the world and to share our experience of life. What a wonderful feeling is when my guests thank me after having spent some unforgettable time in one of my apartments in this great city - Athens. I wouldn't exchange this for the world. I'll be very happy to host you in one of my apartments and provide you with all necessary information and tips on what you 'must see', where and how to go, where to eat (and where not...!!) and so make your life easy and save a lot of your vacation time. I can organize your transports inside/out of Athens (with VIP vehicles), starting from your pick-up from/to the airport, then a tour around the sites of Athens or a short daily escape to the larger Attica or your trip to Delphi, Mycenae, Epidaurus, Ancient Olympia, etc. Don't hesitate to contact me for further (URL HIDDEN) charge...!!).",

      "neighborhood_overview": "Grove Park is one of the most sought-after neighbourhoods in the area for its great location near to the river and the town, picturesque buildings and great transport links into (and away from) London. The river at Strand-on-the-Green is dotted with a range of beautiful pubs and quirky restaurants. Chiswick is a great part of town - very safe and family-friendly and with a location of only 15 minutes from central London. Other nearby tourist attractions include the beautiful grounds of Chiswick House (10 minute walk), the stunning Botanic Kew Gardens (about 20 minutes walk) and the riverboat which you can take from Kew Bridge into Westminster, or in the opposite direction to Hampton Court Palace. Richmond is also not far away, boasting the biggest park in London complete with roaming deer. And for any rugby fans, Twickenham is about 20 minutes down the road.",
      "notes": "The flat sleeps 3-4 comfortably, but with the additional sofa bed in the reception area it is possible to sleep additional guests upon request.",
      "transit": "The apartment is in zone 3, a 10 minute walk from Gunnersbury, which is on the District (Green) line and the Overground (Orange) line. Also within a 10 minute walking distance is Chiswick rail station which is on the South West train line, with trains taking about 20 minutes straight into Waterloo, or out to Surrey, Windsor and further afield travelling in the other direction. For any late-night revellers, the night bus drops you off from central London to the Chiswick High Road 24/7.",
      "access": "The entrance to the apartment is through a hallway which we share with our neighbour who lives in the apartment upstairs. Full access to fully-furnished apartment and garden. Free parking is available on the street outside the property.",
      "interaction": "We rent the apartment out when we are away, but help is always at hand just a phone call away. We also have friends and family nearby who are usually available to pop round if there's a problem.",
      "house_rules": "We love our home and we look after it so we ask only that you do the same. We have good relationships with our closest neighbours, so please treat them with respect by not being too noisy. The apartment is non-smoking, but you are welcome to smoke in the garden using the ashtray provided. Unfortunately the apartment is not suitable for pets.",

Although my husband and I have both lived in London for many years, we moved to Chiswick in 2013 and have been overwhelmed by all that the area has to offer. Conveniently situated between the riverfront and the town with plenty of parks and green spaces nearby, we really do enjoy the best of both worlds. There are also a variety of transport links both into and away from London which makes getting around incredibly easy. We are more than happy to make recommendations of things to do, areas worth visiting and places to eat and drink so please do ask us if you have any questions.",

I came to Australia 15 years ago as a backpacker and travelled all over Australia. I emigrated in 1998 and I love the outdoors lifestyle Australia has to offer. I love living by the beach and going for long walks to Long reef headland or to Curl Curl beach via the cliff walk. My passion is sailing on the harbour and I go yacht racing every weekend and some evenings during the summer. I have my own physiotherapy business in a clinic in Manly as well as providing physiotherapy to the elderly in their homes. I enjoy helping people to recover from injuries and maintain a healthy lifestyle.",
